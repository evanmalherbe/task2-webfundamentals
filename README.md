Level 1 - task 2 - Web fundamentals

Follow these steps:
● Create a simple web page called WebFundamentals.html in which you
briefly answer the following questions:
1. What is Web 3.0 and how is it different from Web 1.0 and Web 2.0?
Read this article for more information.
2. What are the functional differences between the front-end of a web
application and its back-end? See here for more information.
3. In your own words, explain the process that takes place from when
you type a URL into the address bar in your browser until you finally
view the page you have requested. Watch the video entitled “What is
the World Wide Web?” by TedEd to help you understand this better.
Feel free to use any HTML elements that you have learned about in the previous
task to create your web page. Don’t worry if this page looks a bit boring at the
moment. In the next task, you will learn to add images and links to this task.

    <h1 id="top"> Task 2 - Web Fundamentals</h1>
    <h2>Ques 1 - What is Web 3.0 and how is it different from Web 1.0 and Web 2.0?</h2>
    <p><b>Answer: </b>Web 3.0 is the next generation of the world wide web. While it is still a little unclear exactly
        what shape this new evolution of
        the web will take, it will certainly make more use of Artificial Intelligence to provide more relevant content
        to web users. Users will
        have complete control over their own data, thanks to encryption algorithms. This is in contrast to the situation
        at the moment, where huge
        companies like Facebook own the user's data. </p>

    <p>This is different from Web 1.0, which consisted of mainly static web pages that simply presented information and
        images to the users, but did
        not allow the users to interact with or add to the web page at all. All they could do was view the content and
        then leave. </p>

    <p> Web 2.0, which is the stage we are currently in, allows users to upload their own content to websites. This
        allows websites to benefit from
        the knowledge and expertise of millions of people (e.g. Wikipedia). This stage also gave rise to things like
        Blogs, where people could share
        information, images and videos from their own lives or of their experiences. Social media was also born here,
        giving people around the
        world the ability to interact with other people around the world and share their lives. </p>

    <h2>Ques 2 - What are the functional differences between the front-end of a web application and its back-end?</h2>
    <p><b>Answer:</b> The front-end of a website is the part that you see on the page. In other words, the text, images
        and videos on the page. These
        are build and styled using HTML, CSS and Javascript languages. The back-end refers to the logic and information
        handling that is done behind
        the scenes, on the server and with databases. This part of the website is coded using languages such as Python,
        Ruby and PHP.</p>

    <h2>Ques 3 - In your own words, explain the process that takes place from when you type a URL into the address bar
        in your browser until you finally
        view the page you have requested.</h2>
    <p><b>Answer:</b> When you have typed the URL in the browser's address bar, the request for the website is sent to
        your router, it then goes to
        a server at your ISP (internet service provider). Your ISP requests the specific web page from the actual
        website server. The page is sent
        to the ISP and then to your router and finally, to your computer's browser. </p>

    <h2>What one should think about before adding images to your website</h2>
    <p>It is critically important not to use images that are protected by copyright laws on your website.
        Only use images that you own personally, that you have got permission to use from the owner (written),
        or ones that are in the public domain (i.e. they can legally be used by anyone without specific permission)
